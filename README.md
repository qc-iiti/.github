# Quantum Computing Club @ IIT Indore

Welcome to the official GitHub of the **Quantum Computing Club** at [IIT Indore](https://www.iiti.ac.in/). We are a student-driven initiative dedicated to building a strong foundation in quantum computation and information theory — both in theory and in practice.

> _“Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical.”_  
> — Richard Feynman

## 🚀 What We Do

We engage in a broad spectrum of quantum computing activities, including:

- 🧮 **Learning Tracks**: Guided modules in quantum programming (Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, etc.), quantum theory, and algorithms.
- 🧪 **Research Projects**: Collaborative work in quantum machine learning, quantum error correction, and quantum simulation.
- ⚔️ **Competitions**: Internal hackathons and participation in international challenges (QHack, IBM Qiskit Hackathons, etc.).
- 📚 **Seminars & Talks**: Guest lectures, reading groups, and internal knowledge-sharing sessions.

## 🧑‍🔬 Who Can Join?

Everyone is welcome, regardless of prior experience. Whether you're:

- a **complete beginner** interested in quantum mechanics or computing,
- an **MTech / MSc student** looking to apply your background to quantum systems,
- or a **research enthusiast** aiming to collaborate on real-world problems,

— there's a place for you in the club.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

We work with:

- **Quantum Frameworks**: Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, Braket, Q#
- **Classical Tools**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter
- **Platforms**: IBM Quantum, Xanadu's Strawberry Fields, Rigetti Forest, QuTiP, etc.
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 💬 How to Get Involved

1. **Start a project** – Fork any repo, open an issue, or propose a new idea.
2. **Attend workshops** – We regularly host learning sessions and reading groups.
3. **Contribute** – Help with code, documentation, or content.
